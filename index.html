    <h3>
      You are required to sort an array of objects, where each student is
      represented as an object (check sample test cases in the following link:
      https://ag-quiz-2022.surge.sh/students.js).

      <br />
      <p>
        Each object has 4 keys, i.e, name, chemistry marks, biology marks, and
        date of birth. You should sort the array of objects according to the
        following rules:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. The first priority is the total marks.<br />
        2. In case the students have the same total marks, the next priority
        should be the number of marks in biology.<br />
        3. If students have the same marks in biology, and chemistry and have
        the same date of birth, then any order between them is acceptable.
        <br />
